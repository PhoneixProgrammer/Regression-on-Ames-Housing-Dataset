# Regression-on-Ames-Housing-Dataset
# • Visualizing the univariate distribution of each continuous variable, and the distribution of the target 
# • Visualizing the dependency of the target on each continuous feature
# • Cross-validating a linear regression model for nominal variables using one-hot encoding. And visualizing the relationship of the categorical variable of best R2 value with the target. 
# • Used column transformer and pipeline to encode ordinal, nominal, and discrete variables. 
# • Evaluate Linear Regression (OLS), Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet using cross-validation with the default parameters.
# • Scaling the data within the pipeline using Standard Scaler.
# • Tuned the parameters of the model using Gridsearch CV and visualized the dependence of the validation score on the parameters for Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet.
# • Visualizing the coefficients of the resulting model to determine which features are important.
